## YouFaceIt ü§ñüéÆ

YouFaceIt is a discord bot made with [Discord.js](https://discord.js.org/).
It allows players on a server to show their latest **FaceIt CS:GO** game info and result, detect who played best and worst, show personal stats etc.

_The idea was born on our Discord server, our team needed a way to automate the indication of who played worst and needed to improve their game (and call him a noob of course) and who played best in order to praise them for good job!_

You can add this bot to your server from [Top.gg page](https://top.gg/bot/760549048477286420)

### Usage üë•

When your bot is up and running and is added to your Discord server, you can use the following commands:

- `!yf add [FaceIt nickname]` - to add a player to a watch list
- `!yf remove [FaceIt nickname]` - to remove a player from the list
- `!yf list` - show the watch list of added players
- `!yf show` - detect latest common game of 2 and more players in the list and show info about the match
- `!yf help` - show help and commands info
